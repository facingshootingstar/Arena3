/**
 * A small in-process sliding-window limiter for endpoints that are cheap to
 * call and expensive to honour — plan requests, password changes, the
 * assistant.
 *
 * Deliberately in-memory: the limits here exist to stop one impatient member
 * double-tapping a button into twenty rows, not to defend against a botnet. A
 * shared store would mean a round trip to Postgres on the happy path of every
 * request, which is the opposite of what this codebase needs. On a serverless
 * platform each instance keeps its own counters, so a burst spread across
 * lambdas gets a slightly higher effective ceiling — still far below the
 * damage a tight client loop can do, which is the case we actually hit.
