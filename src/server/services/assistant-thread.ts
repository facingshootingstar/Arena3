/**
 * A seal on each AI reply, so the browser can send the thread back and the
 * server can tell its own past answers from ones a browser made up.
 *
 * The server used to drop every assistant turn the browser sent, because a
 * browser that may write the assistant's past can talk the model into a
 * discount or a free court that does not exist. With only the member's turns
 * left, the model saw a row of unanswered questions and answered the oldest
 * one again. A reply now comes back with `sig` = "<issued-at>.<HMAC(member,
 * issued-at, question, reply)>": only a question → answer pair whose seal
 * checks out reaches the model, so a real answer cannot be glued onto a
 * different question either.
 *
 * What the seal does not stop, by design: a member resending their own real
 * answers. Seals expire after THREAD_TTL_MS and pairs must arrive in the order
 * they were issued, so the most a member can do is replay, within a day,
 * something this server really told them — no new words for the assistant.
 *
 * The key is ASSISTANT_SECRET (or OTP_SECRET) and must be the same on every
 * instance. Without one it is random per process: a restart, or a second
 * server, then only makes old threads start fresh — the behaviour before this
 * change, not a hole — and production says so once in the log.
